# ALX React Fundamentals: Core Concepts & Components

A modular **React application** constructed to **demonstrate mastery of component architecture**. This repository houses projects that explore the fundamental building blocks of modern SPA development, including JSX, props, and state management.

## 📂 Project Structure

| Project | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[alx-react-app](./alx-react-app/)** | A Vite-powered React application featuring a dynamic **User Profile Card** and reusable components. |
